We’re dedicated to empowering this transformation by building the tools and experiences that thousands of developers use to create their own products. Plaid powers the tools millions of people rely on to live a healthier financial life. We work with thousands of companies like Venmo, SoFi, several of the Fortune 500, and many of the largest banks to make it easy for people to connect their financial accounts to the apps and services they want to use. Plaid’s network covers 12,000 financial institutions across the US, Canada, UK and Europe. Founded in 2013, the company is headquartered in San Francisco with offices in New York, Washington D.C., London and Amsterdam.\n\nPlaid’s Platform Engineering organization comprises multiple teams focused on core infrastructure, data platforms, storage, privacy, and developer efficiency. Together, these teams ensure that Plaid’s technology platform is scalable, reliable, and secure to support our rapid growth. Our infrastructure handles millions of requests per day, and we pride ourselves on maintaining highly robust and performant systems. As a Platform Engineer, you will design, build, and maintain the foundational infrastructure and internal platforms that empower all of Plaid’s engineering teams to move quickly and safely. You’ll work cross-functionally with product engineering squads to ship new features and ensure operational excellence throughout each product’s lifecycle.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nDesign & Develop Scalable Systems: Build and maintain core platform services with a focus on performance, reliability, and scalability. You will create and evolve distributed backend systems that serve as the bedrock for products used by millions of users. Infrastructure & Data Platforms: Develop and improve infrastructure for data storage and processing – for example, high-performance databases and modern data processing frameworks – to handle Plaid’s growing data and product needs. Ensure our data infrastructure is robust and can scale effectively. Developer Productivity Tools: Create internal tools, frameworks, and automation to improve developer productivity and efficiency. This includes building CI/CD pipelines, observability and monitoring systems, and self-service infrastructure platforms that enable teams to ship code quickly and safely. Security & Privacy by Design: Integrate security, privacy, and compliance best practices into our platforms (e.g. data encryption, access controls, audit logging) to protect sensitive financial data. Work closely with Security and Privacy teams to ensure our infrastructure and internal services meet high standards for data protection and regulatory compliance.
